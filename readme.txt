= How to sell live webinars (do paid webinars) in WordPress... =

* Paid live & evergreen webinars: with Stripe, PayPal and since 2.9.1.0+ also with WooCommerce
[See article and video for details ](https://webinarignition.tawk.help/article/creating-paid-webinars)

* With KlickTipp and WebinarIgnition
Connect the payment processor like PayPal or Digistore24 with KlickTipp.
On the payment tag, sent a mail with the one-click registration link:
Use the link in emails. Replace NAME/EMAIL with wildcards e.g. %Subscriber:CustomFieldFirstName% %Subscriber:EmailAddress%
https://your-domain.com/live-webinar/?register-now&n=NAME&e=EMAIL

* With MailChimp ect. and WebinarIgnition
Connect the payment processor like PayPal MailChimp.
On payment confirmation, sent a mail with the one click registration link:
Use the link in emails. Replace NAME/EMAIL with wildcards e.g. MailChimp with *|EMAIL|* *|FNAME|* and the link looks like this with the parameter added.
https://your-domain.com/live-webinar/?register-now&n=*|FNAME|*&e=*|EMAIL|*

**User story, how a user gets automatically registered to a webinar:**
Before the email is sent the parameter in the link are replaced by NAME/EMAIL of the user.
When user click the link in his postbox he will be auto-registered and redirected to the webinar confirmation page.

**One-click registration only working at the moment with live webinars.** If you want to sell also evergreen/automated/recorded Webinar then hide your webinar registration page and give access only to the customers. So you share the link to the registration page instead of using the one click registration link.

**By the way:** One click registration for evergreen is on our very long nice-to-have feature list. If you need it ASAP then we give you a quote and do it quicker.
We can develop a solution to start the webinar 5 minutes after the user clicked the link.
You can do a 6 Minutes countdown in your email and a 5 minutes countdown on the registration confirmation page.

Some cases:

* You can get them back when they drop out for any reason.
* If too long outside the webinar and CTA not seen offer a new webinar date.
* Sell if they have not bought but seen the whole webinar.
* Upsell if they have seen the whole webinar and bought.

* Freemius SDK update. Now auto cleaning DB entries 

--
Soon, delayed because security fixes first: 

* Fixed: Live auto login 
Working now with base64 encrypted name and email address and with plain.

= Evergreen auto fill URL in dashboard =

Will be improved, together with the live auto fill and login
We think of adding a security token so misuse of the link is not possible.
Case: Intruder see WebinarIgnition registration and add "?register-now&n=NAME&e=EMAIL&readonly=true&login=true" to the link and fill name and email of other persons which then gets registered.
* Current development: Make working with custom pages created by adding shortcodes.

= mail confirmation on registration =

* Current beta and ready for testing: 
At the moment only working with the autofill URL feature
Only the the token registered user will not need to confirm.
Why no need to confirm? Because the click on a link inside an email to their account.
Why adding email confirmation? Often seen and helping to get valid and proofed owned email addresses

FAQ: 
Question: Why we will not have an auto login on evergreen?
Answer: Because attendee should be able to choose a date & time to attend the webinar. Live Webinars have a fixed date & time.

* Current parallel development: Total new plugin

= Helper texts  = 

* New: Added help text to change FROM EMAIL address and NAME EMAIL and link to KB article in settings.
Background: Woocommerce and other big plugins do not have email settings and refer to SMTP plugins, so do we.
* Added: Global warning message when running "old" webinars $date_before = '2022-03-25' that may not work as expected.
Instead of getting frustrated and uninstalling the plugin, re-run the webinar from scratch. (Importing, duplicating will not solve anything).
I guarantee the experience will be totally different. 
Background: DB structure has changed.
Better to do a completely new webinar where everything works fine.

= Other =

(Branded version has 100 free registrations per month with all features)

* Reduced: Branding free registrations per month to 100
* Improved: Update webinar permalink if post permalink changed
Benefits: When you change slug/URL of the default page webinar will still work.
Background: Inside webinar settings click on edit and it leads you to the default page, used by this webinar.
Please do not change if you sent out notifications already, because the link in mail will not work.

Still in free version you get all live and evergreen features, just with a time limit and a registration limit.

[CTA loading issues? Load all plugins/shortcodes in CTAs (please right click and open in new tab)](https://webinarignition.tawk.help/article/cta-loading-issues)

* Solved problem: In webinar room not showing timed action content nicely
* Background: The delayed/time based loading of the CTAs was sometimes breaking style and function of some plugins/shortcodes output.
* Benefits: Automatically loading via iframe, by checking a box, solve this issue.
* Yes, iframes in iframes working too.
* What are CTAs?
Call-to-Actions are actions in the webinar room to interact with your attendees, like in a live webinar
CTAs in evergreen webinars are automated and time based (connected to the MP4/video time)
* How you solved the problem of the form that on submit reloads the whole webinar room?
By placing the form in an iframe the content in the iframe will reload only.
* Is it complicated to load the content in an Iframe?
You decide: If install/activate free "advanced iframe" plugin and click "enable" button, below the CTA content, is complicated ;-)

* [Article: CTA loading issues? Load all plugins/shortcodes in CTAs](https://webinarignition.tawk.help/article/cta-loading-issues)

PS: In combination with the already developed features automation in evergreen webinars raised to new heights.
To name some:

* On reload the page, attendee continues video on the time left (MP4, WEBM,... only, not iframe)
* Unlimited CTAs because all are shown inside the webinar room.
CTAs can be any shortcodes appointment/survey/poll... forms, WooCommerce Shop, or an external sales page.
* Send registered/attended status to CRM via webhook and do more specific marketing.

PPS: Is the iframe advanced plugin totally free?
Yes and no. At the moment from 10.000 views a months the iframe plugin shows a backlink.
And you can get rig of the link by buying the pro version [At the moment 19$ one time](https://codecanyon.net/item/advanced-iframe-pro/5344999)

iframed CTA Roadmap: 

* Problem: Loading the Iframed CTA could take some time than loading the normal CTA
Why? Because we hidden loading the whole page and show only the content you want to get.
Workaround: If you want to show the CTA at 1:15 start the CTA at 1:00 time
Solution: Preloading the CTA, out of the view of the user and show on CTA time.
* As we have a cooperation with Michael the developer of Iframe advance free/pro he come up with more improvements 
Maybe you have some edge cases that need tweaking and we lucky to help you...

= No Premium Plugin code needed as all is in OpenSource Version = 

* From my own experience i like to test all before i buy.
* Still buying is not needed until you reach the free 500 registrations per months or like webinars longer than 45 minutes.
* Which other webinar service gives you so much for free?
* Why? To play, test, make some money and give back. That maybe make some user able to start own lifelong business.
* Also i like all to use e.g. the webhooks, paid webinars ect. and suggest features and improvements.
* Current Ultimate Unlimited user will still get updates through Freemius.
* Ultimate Unlimited user can install the free version and get faster updates.

= Further fixes, improvements =

* Updated: German language file (Thank you Ronny)
* Updated: All translations and fixes some strings. 
Please report not working or not good translation.
* Freemius SDK update
Fixes in clone resolution and multisite license activation
Fixed update notice issue when free and premium versions of a plugin is running in parallel
* Fixed: Webhook trigger on attended webinar when user was not instantly viewing the webinar. (Thanks Mathias)
Trigger sent when user watched MP4 video for one second and more. Iframe video on visited webinar room.

= Fixed: Redirect to first custom registration page when open the default registration page =

(only redirect for non logged-in user, like your webinar visitors, so you as admin can still access the built in page)
Benefits: The not setup default registration page is not shown to your visitors.
If you use custom pages you need to manually select a default custom page and deselect the default page.

Workaround for existing and new webinars:

* In an Webinar dashboard
* Select a default custom registration page
* Unselect built in registration page in list
* Save
* Redo when default still shown in the list.

I hope soon we can improve admin experience by setting the first custom page as default/fallback page.

= The Unlimited Registration features is the milestone that needed the improvement =

= 3.03.2 22.08.2023 =

* Fix: Language special characters producing JS errors
Benefits: You can run WebinarIgnition on any site language and all will be translated.
Benefits: AR Test button working again 
Missing languages you can request DeepL translation in chat, or translate yourself via loco translate.
* Fix: Webinar settings language resets on test AR settings

= 3.03.0 20.08.2023 =

* Fixed: Issues with urdu and italian special characters by escaping all text in backend (make language strings not executable)
Benefits: All languages can be used in backend.
Tutorial: On create webinar you choose the language the content shown to the user is translated in. Like registration form/pages, email/txt reminder.
The settings language follows the user and the site language. We think of removing the "also use the webinar language in settings" option. You can give us cases when this option is needed and we will fix it.
At the moment on saving the webinar, only the settings language change back to the site/user language. Use the chat for suggestions.

= Team news =

= Upcoming iframe loading of CTA content with shortcodes = 

* Background: The delayed/time based loading of the CTAs was normally breaking style and function of some plugins output.
* Benefits: Automatically loading via iframe, by checking a box, solve this issue.
We are testing already final version. 

= 3.02.1 26.07.2023 =

* Fixed yeah: Show browser confirmation popup only when changes are unsaved (on backend)
Why reloading was added? Because all settings are saved in one Array and the reload apply the settings.
Benefits: When move away from a settings page no asking of leaving the page.
Only reload after save to apply settings ;-)

After testing live on one evergreen site working on other still showing the message.
Please add your ideas, dev will investigate further...

In development 

* Easy CTA solution, by michael from advanced iframe

* Better onboarding emails (Chris & Tobias)
* Better KB content (Chris & Tobias)

* Fix: Default WP language issue (Some text are not in site language and site language not selected by default)
One more step in the direction of being more like WordPress
Benefits: Your site is in spanish and your webinar text, settings is in spanish by default
Note: If the admin... user language is different than the site language, the site language is still offert when create a new webinar.
Note: If you want latin spanish select espanol de mexico, that will save you to translate. Same with Portugues....

* Incompatible: CTA video Shortcode for registration page not working when WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) is installed. 
WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) JS causing an error and video gets out of shape. We try to harden WI to solve it.

*  Incompatible: 10web hosting user like webinarignition.com have a redirect to default registration page issue 
We working hard to solve it. until fixed demo not available. You only see the issue when you are logged out.
